# TP1-Venn_Diagram
A study about Venn Diagram : Alternative names, History, Description, Anatomy, Functions, Comments, Variations.



# Alternative names :
- Primary diagram
- Set diagram
- Logic diagram



# History :
Venn diagrams were introduced in 1880 by John Venn in a paper entitled On the Diagrammatic and Mechanical Representation of Propositions and Reasonings in the "Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science", about the different ways to represent propositions by diagrams. The use of these types of diagrams in formal logic, according to Frank Ruskey and Mark Weston, is "not an easy history to trace, but it is certain that the diagrams that are popularly associated with Venn, in fact, originated much earlier. They are rightly associated with Venn, however, because he comprehensively surveyed and formalized their usage, and was the first to generalize them".

Venn himself did not use the term "Venn diagram" and referred to his invention as "Eulerian Circles". For example, in the opening sentence of his 1880 article Venn writes, "Schemes of diagrammatic representation have been so familiarly introduced into logical treatises during the last century or so, that many readers, even those who have made no professional study of logic, may be supposed to be acquainted with the general nature and object of such devices. Of these schemes one only, viz. that commonly called 'Eulerian circles,' has met with any general acceptance..." The first to use the term "Venn diagram" was Clarence Irving Lewis in 1918, in his book "A Survey of Symbolic Logic". [1]




# Description :
A Venn Diagram is a diagram that visually displays all the possible logical relationships between a collection of sets. Each set is typically represented with a circle.

Contained within each set is a collection of objects or entities that all have something in common. When sets overlap, itâ€™s known as the intersection area. This is where entities that have all the qualities of the overlapping sets.

The example on this page is of a 2-set Venn Diagram. However, there are also 3, 4, 5, 6 and even 7-set Venn Diagrams that exist, which display a more complex geometry between sets. [2]

# Functions
-Comparisons :
Visualisation methods that help show the differences or similarities between values.
-Concepts :
Visualisation methods that help explain and show ideas or concepts.
-Relationships !
Visualization methods that show relationships and connections between the data or show correlations between two or more variables.




# Comments
-Extensions to higher numbers of sets
Venn diagrams typically represent two or three sets, but there are forms that allow for higher numbers. Shown below, four intersecting    spheres form the highest order Venn diagram that has the symmetry of a simplex and can be visually represented. The 16 intersections    correspond to the vertices of a tesseract (or the cells of a 16-cell respectively). [1]

For higher numbers of sets, some loss of symmetry in the diagrams is unavoidable. Venn was keen to find "symmetrical figures...elegant in themselves," that represented higher numbers of sets, and he devised an elegant four-set diagram using ellipses (see below). He also gave a construction for Venn diagrams for any number of sets, where each successive curve that delimits a set interleaves with previous curves, starting with the three-circle diagram. [1]

# Variations 

- Euler Diagrams : 
Euler diagrams consist of simple closed shapes in a two dimensional plane that each depict a set or category. How or if these shapes overlap demonstrates the relationships between the sets. There are only 3 possible relationships between any 2 sets; completely inclusive, partially inclusive, and exclusive. This is also referred to as containment, overlap or neither or, especially in mathematics, it may be referred to as subset, intersection and disjointed.

Each Euler curve divides the plane into two regions or "zones": the interior, which symbolically represents the elements of the set, and the exterior, which represents all elements that are not members of the set. Curves whose interior zones do not intersect represent disjoint sets. Two curves whose interior zones intersect represent sets that have common elements; the zone inside both curves represents the set of elements common to both sets (the intersection of the sets). A curve that is contained completely within the interior zone of another represents a subset of it. [3].
